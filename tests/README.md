# Sparkbot Library Tests

A set of samples to test the Sparkbot library features. 


- [express-all-in-one](express-all-in-one.js): a simple HTTP service based on Express, listening to incoming WebHook Resource/Events

- [onEvent-all-all](onEvent-all-all.js), [onEvent-messages-created](onEvent-messages-created.js) : examples of listeners to specific Webhook (Resources/Event) triggers. Leverages Sparkbot function: webhook.onEvent().

- [onMessage](onMessage.js) : examples of listeners invoked when new message contents are succesfully fetched from Spark. Leverages Sparkbot function: webhook.onMessage(). 

- [onMessage-asCommand](onMessage-asCommand.js) : illustrates how to interpret the message as a bot command. Leverages Sparkbot function: webhook.onMessage().

- [onCommand](onCommand.js): shortcut to listen to a specific command. Leverages Sparkbot function: webhook.onCommand().


## Run locally

Each sample can be launched from the same set of command lines install then run calls.

Note that the SPARK_TOKEN env variable is required to run all samples that read message contents.

Once your bot is started, read this [guide to expose it publically and create a Spark webhook](../docs/HowToRegisterOnSpark.md).
