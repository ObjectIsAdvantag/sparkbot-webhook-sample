Features illustrated by this example:
- Help message to display bot commands
- Welcome message as the bot is added in a room
- **Custom command prefix #**
- **Markdown formatting with lists & mentions**
- **Runs with a Developer account**

Note that this webhook must be run with a Developer access token (either your's or a fake Spark account), because we must fetch all messages from rooms, not only those where bot is mentionned.

Invite _stats@chatbot.land_ to meet the bot.
